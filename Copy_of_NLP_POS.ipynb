In January 1817 it's wreck was located in a wide, deep bay near the mouth of the Macleay River. The bay was then named after the wrecked ship.  It became a place of shelter for coastal shipping and prison labour was brought in to enlarge the area with a breakwater. Work began on the construction of a prison, the first wing completed in 1879 but the first prisoners did not move in until 1886. The prison was closed in 1903 but re-opened during the 1914-1918 war. Over 500 German prisoners of war were held there but the building was once again closed after WW1. Many years later due to the ravages of war and vandals the ruin is but a shell of it's former self but the atmosphere within the remaining walls is tangible.\\n~Von~ © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes     \""
